This research/project's primary aim was to eliminate the need for an oscilloscope and achieve the same with in a Virtual Instrument such that its more accessible. My main takeaway from this project was 
												<li>Coordinated with a team of 5 with the aim of creating a “low cost” PC Based Oscilloscope.</li>
												<li> Developed an 8 channel Virtual DSO. Implemented in NI LabVIEW Virtual Instrument.</li>

										<h2> Certifications and Trainings</h2>
										</header>
										<p>Here is a List of the major Certifications and Trainings undergone by me during my undergraduate. These Certifications and Trainings were vital in improving my fundamentals in my interest fields both Theoretically and Pratically.I have also completed many online certifications from various platforms including Coursera, Edx, Udemy and SimpliLearn which helped me understand the fundamentals of many high level applications.</p>
										<li>
												<b><a href="https://courses.edx.org/certificates/b5bda69a1f114b1ca229e3e76b55f1b0">Autonomous Mobile Robots - EdX (ETHx Zurich)</a></b><p> This course taught me the fundamentals of mobile robots . The objective of this course is to provide the basic concepts and algorithms required to develop mobile robots that act autonomously in complex environments. The main emphasis is put on mobile robot locomotion and kinematics, environment perception, probabilistic map based localization and mapping, and motion planning. The lectures and exercises of this course introduce several types of robots such as wheeled robots, legged robots and drones.</p></li>
											<li>
												<b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/J3TFE6NVSZJH">Control Of Mobile Robots - Coursera (Georgia Institute of Technology)</a></b><p>Control of Mobile Robots is a course that focuses on the application of modern control theory to the problem of making robots move around in safe and effective ways. One of my main take away from this course is, creating a model for a differential drive robot by solving the Navigation problem using switches to switch between "Goal to Goal" behaviour and "Obstacle Avoidance" behaviour and being able to scale up the model to other robots as well.</p></li>
											<li>
												<b><a href="https://certificates.simplicdn.net/share/1986859.pdf">Machine Learning Advanced Certification Training - Simpli Learn</a></b><p> This online course offers an in-depth overview of Machine Learning topics including working with real-time data, developing algorithms using supervised & unsupervised learning, regression, classification, and time series modeling.

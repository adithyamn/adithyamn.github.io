								<h3><b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/JQX8YJQ5A2S2">Introduction to Self-Driving Cars</a></b></h3>
									<p>This course laid the foundation for various segments incorporated in the development of an
									autonomous vehicle. Learned the various terminology, design considerations and safety assessment of
									self-driving cars.
									</p>
								<h3><b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/ASDMHH5HAAY9">State Estimation and Localization for Self-Driving Cars</a></b></h3>
								<p>Introduced to different sensors and their use for state estimation and localization in self-driving car.
								Developed models for localisation sensors such as IMU and GPS and applied Extended and Unscented Kalman Filter for the estimation problem.</p>
								<h3><b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/KY2R76AFW34J">Visual Perception for Self-Driving Cars</a></h3></b>
								<p>Derived a pin-hole camera model and Performed intrinsic and extrinsic calculations on it. Performed static and dynamic object detection using deep learning. Applied semantic segmentation for the estimation of the drivable surface.
</p>
								<h3><b><a href="https://www.coursera.org/account/accomplishments/records/BZ4ZMB82RS7Y">Motion Planning for Self-Driving Cars</a></h3></b> 
								<p>Learned the fundamental concepts of all the different motion planners such as mission planner,
								behavioural planner. Implemented Dijkstraâ€™s and A* algorithm to find the shortest path between two places. Introduced to a Hierarchical motion planner to navigate autonomously through an environment using the carla simulator.</p>
